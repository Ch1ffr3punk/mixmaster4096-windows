# mixmaster4096-windows

To set the path for mix.exe in the current directory, use: set MIX3PATH=.\  

Additional utilities:

sendmail.exe - because Richard's Mixmaster 3.1 produces only outfiles.
mip.exe - convert .jpeg or .png images to proper MIME base64 encoded    
email messages or Usenet postings.   
mse.exe - convert Subject: content with UTF-8 characters to MIME base64. 

Please note: For sendmail.exe you need tor.exe, listening on port 9050    
installed, or when using the Nym Mixnet port 1080 enabled in sendmail.cfg.
